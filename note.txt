> Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.

> For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, 
    and that every program must contain the main() method.

> String (S is capital), use boolean (not bool)

> you can add the final keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) 
    to overwrite existing values (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", 
    which means unchangeable and read-only)

> All Java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

> The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, 
    while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. 
    Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

> String is non-primitive because only class can have methods. 
    Primitive can not. And String need many functions to be called upon while 
    processing like substring, indexof, equals, touppercase. 
    It would not have been possible without making it class.
